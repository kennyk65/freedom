== History ==
{{Main|History of Tibet}}
{{Tibetan Buddhism sidebar}}
In Central Asian Buddhist countries, it has been widely believed for the last millennium that [[Avalokiteśvara]], the [[bodhisattva]] of compassion, has a special relationship with the people of Tibet and intervenes in their fate by incarnating as benevolent rulers and teachers such as the Dalai Lamas. This is according to ''The Book of Kadam'', the main text of the [[Kadampa]] school, to which the [[1st Dalai Lama]], [[Gendun Drup]], first belonged.<ref>{{cite book |author = Thubten Jinpa |title = The Book of Kadam |publisher=Wisdom Publications |isbn = 978-0-86171-441-4 |chapter-url = http://www.wisdompubs.org/book/book-kadam/introduction |chapter=Introduction |quote = Available textual evidence points strongly toward the 11th and 12th centuries as the period during which the full myth of Avalokiteśvara's special destiny with Tibet was established. During this era, the belief that this compassionate spirit intervenes in the fate of the Tibetan people by manifesting as benevolent rulers and teachers took firm root|date = 15 July 2008 }}</ref>
In fact, this text is said to have laid the foundation for the Tibetans' later identification of the Dalai Lamas as incarnations of Avalokiteśvara.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Thubten Jinpa|title=The Book of Kadam|publisher=Wisdom Publications|isbn=978-0-86171-441-4|chapter-url=http://www.wisdompubs.org/book/book-kadam/introduction|chapter=Introduction|quote=Perhaps the most important legacy of the book, at least for the Tibetan people as a whole, is that it laid the foundation for the later identification of Avalokiteśvara with the lineage of the Dalai Lama|date=15 July 2008}}</ref>{{better source|reason=This is a popular publisher, and due to position author has distance to subject is not sufficient.

It traces the legend of the bodhisattva's incarnations as [[List of rulers of Tibet|early Tibetan kings and emperors]] such as [[Songtsen Gampo]] and later as [[Dromtönpa]] (1004–1064).<ref>{{cite book |author = Thubten Jinpa |title=The Book of Kadam |publisher=Wisdom Publications |isbn = 978-0-86171-441-4 |chapter-url = http://www.wisdompubs.org/book/book-kadam/introduction |chapter=Introduction |quote = For the Tibetans, the mythic narrative that began with Avalokiteśvara's embodiment in the form of Songtsen Gampo in the seventh century—or even earlier with the mythohistorical figures of the first king of Tibet, Nyatri Tsenpo (traditionally calculated to have lived around the fifth century B.C.E.), and Lha Thothori Nyentsen (ca. third century c.e.), during whose reign some sacred Buddhist scriptures are believed to have arrived in Tibet... continued with Dromtönpa in the eleventh century|date=15 July 2008 }}</ref>

This lineage has been extrapolated by Tibetans up to and including the Dalai Lamas.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Thubten Jinpa|title=The Book of Kadam|publisher=Wisdom Publications|isbn=978-0-86171-441-4|chapter-url=http://www.wisdompubs.org/book/book-kadam/introduction|chapter=Introduction|quote=For the Tibetans, the mythic narrative... continues today in the person of His Holiness Tenzin Gyatso, the Fourteenth Dalai Lama|date=15 July 2008}}</ref>

=== Origins in myth and legend ===
Thus, according to such sources, an informal line of succession of the present Dalai Lamas as incarnations of [[Avalokiteśvara]] stretches back much further than [[Gendun Drub]]. ''The Book of Kadam'',<ref>{{cite book|author1=Thubten Jinpa|title=The Book of Kadam|publisher=Wisdom Publications|isbn=978-0-86171-441-4|url=http://www.wisdompubs.org/book/book-kadam|date=15 July 2008}}</ref> the compilation of Kadampa teachings largely composed around discussions between the Indian sage [[Atiśa]] (980–1054) and his Tibetan host and chief disciple [[Dromtönpa]]<ref>{{cite book|author1=Thubten Jinpa|title=The Book of Kadam|publisher=Wisdom Publications|isbn=978-0-86171-441-4|chapter-url=http://www.wisdompubs.org/book/book-kadam/introduction|chapter=Introduction|quote='The Book' gives ample evidence of the existence of an ancient, mythological Tibetan narrative placing the Dalai Lamas as incarnations of Dromtönpa, of his predecessors and of [[Avalokiteshvara]]|date=15 July 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author1=Tuttle, Gray|author2=Schaeffer, Curtis R.|title=The Tibetan History Reader|date=2013|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-51354-8|page=335|quote=In Atiśa's telling, Dromtön was not only Avalokiteśvara but also a reincarnation of former Buddhist monks, laypeople, commoners, and kings. Furthermore, these reincarnations were all incarnations of that very same being, Avalokiteśvara. Van der Kuijp takes us on a tour of literary history, showing that the narrative attributed to Atiśa became a major source for both incarnation and reincarnation ideology for centuries to come." From: "The Dalai Lamas and the Origins of Reincarnate Lamas. Leonard W. J. van der Kuijp"}}</ref> and '''Tales of the Previous Incarnations of Arya Avalokiteśvara''',<ref>Mullin 2001, p. 39.</ref> nominate as many as sixty persons prior to Gendun Drub who are enumerated as earlier incarnations of Avalokiteśvara and predecessors in the same lineage leading up to him. In brief, these include a mythology of 36 Indian personalities plus 10 [[List of rulers of Tibet|early Tibetan kings and emperors]], all said to be previous incarnations of Dromtönpa, and fourteen further Nepalese and Tibetan yogis and sages in between him and the 1st Dalai Lama.<ref>Stein (1972), p. 138–139|quote=the Dalai Lama is ... a link in the chain that starts in history and leads back through legend to a deity in mythical times.

=== Avalokiteśvara's "Dalai Lama master plan" ===
According to the [[14th Dalai Lama]], long ago Avalokiteśvara had promised the [[Buddha]] to guide and protect the [[Tibetan people]] and in the late Middle Ages, his master plan to fulfill this promise was the stage-by-stage establishment of the Dalai Lama theocracy in Tibet.<ref name=Laird138>Laird 2006, p. 138.</ref>

First, Tsongkhapa established three great monasteries around Lhasa in the province of [[Ü (region)|Ü]] before he died in 1419.<ref name=norb216>Norbu 1968, p. 216.</ref> The 1st Dalai Lama soon became Abbot of the greatest one, [[Drepung]], and developed a large popular power base in Ü. He later extended this to cover Tsang,<ref>Mullin 2001, p. 59.</ref> where he constructed a fourth great monastery, [[Tashilhunpo Monastery|Tashi Lhunpo]], at [[Shigatse]].<ref>Mullin 2001, pp. 66–67.</ref> The [[2nd Dalai Lama|2nd]] studied there before returning to Lhasa,<ref name=Laird138 /> where he became Abbot of Drepung.<ref name=TN1>Smith 1997, p. 106.</ref> Having reactivated the 1st's large popular followings in Tsang and Ü,<ref>Laird 2006, p. 138–139.</ref> the 2nd then moved on to southern Tibet and gathered more followers there who helped him construct a new monastery, [[Chokorgyel Monastery|Chokorgyel]].<ref name=shak91>Shakabpa 1984, p. 91.</ref> He also established the method by which later Dalai Lama incarnations would be discovered through visions at the "oracle lake", [[Lhamo Lhatso]].<ref name="laird139">Laird 2006, p. 139.</ref> The [[3rd Dalai Lama|3rd]] built on his predecessors' fame by becoming Abbot of the two great monasteries of Drepung and [[Sera Monastery|Sera]].<ref name="laird139" /> The stage was set for the great Mongol King [[Altan Khan]], hearing of his reputation, to invite the 3rd to [[Mongolia]] where he converted the King and his followers to Buddhism, as well as other Mongol princes and their followers covering a vast tract of central Asia. Thus most of Mongolia was added to the Dalai Lama's sphere of influence, founding a spiritual empire which largely survives to the modern age.<ref>Laird 2006, pp. 140–145.</ref> After being given the Mongolian name 'Dalai',<ref>MacKay 2003, p. 18.</ref> he returned to Tibet to found the great monasteries of [[Lithang]] in Kham, eastern Tibet and [[Kumbum Monastery|Kumbum]] in Amdo, north-eastern Tibet.<ref>Laird 2006, p. 146.</ref> The [[4th Dalai Lama|4th]] was then born in Mongolia as the great grandson of [[Altan Khan]], thus cementing strong ties between Central Asia, the Dalai Lamas, the [[Gelugpa]] and [[Tibet]].<ref>Laird 2006, pp. 147–149.</ref> Finally, in fulfilment of Avalokiteśvara's master plan, the [[5th Dalai Lama|5th]] in the succession used the vast popular power base of devoted followers built up by his four predecessors. By 1642, a strategy that was planned and carried out by his resourceful ''chagdzo'' or manager [[Sonam Rapten]] with the military assistance of his devoted disciple [[Gushri Khan]], Chieftain of the [[Khoshut]] Mongols, enabled the 'Great 5th' to found the Dalai Lamas' religious and political reign over more or less the whole of Tibet that survived for over 300 years.<ref>Laird 2006, pp. 149–151.</ref>

Thus the Dalai Lamas became pre-eminent spiritual leaders in Tibet and 25 Himalayan and Central Asian kingdoms and countries bordering Tibet and their prolific literary works have "for centuries acted as major sources of spiritual and philosophical inspiration to more than fifty million people of these lands".<ref>Mullin 1982, p.''iv''</ref> Overall, they have played "a monumental role in Asian literary, philosophical and religious history".<ref>Mullin 1983, p. 29.</ref>

=== Establishment of the Dalai Lama lineage ===
Gendun Drup (1391–1474), a disciple of the founder [[Je Tsongkhapa|Je Tsongkapa]],<ref name="陈庆英2005_p15">{{cite book|author=陈庆英|title=达赖喇嘛转世及历史定制英|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=haMIsdC3iZwC&pg=PA15|year=2005|publisher=五洲传播出版社|isbn=978-7-5085-0745-3|pages=16–}}</ref> was the ordination name of the monk who came to be known as the '[[First Dalai Lama]]', but only from 104 years after he died.<ref name=rich>Richardson 1984, pp. 40–41.</ref>
There had been resistance, since first he was ordained a monk in the Kadampa tradition<ref name=shak91 /> and for various reasons, for hundreds of years the Kadampa school had eschewed the adoption of the ''tulku'' system to which the older schools adhered.<ref name=mull87>Mullin 2001, p. 87.</ref> [[Tsongkhapa]] largely modelled his new, reformed [[Gelugpa]] school on the Kadampa tradition and refrained from starting a tulku system.<ref>Mullin 2001, pp. 94–95.</ref> Therefore, although Gendun Drup grew to be a very important Gelugpa lama, after he died in 1474 there was no question of any search being made to identify his incarnation.<ref name=mull87 />

Despite this, when the Tashilhunpo monks started hearing what seemed credible accounts that a incarnation of Gendun Drup had appeared nearby and repeatedly announced himself from the age of two, their curiosity was aroused.<ref>Mullin 2001, pp. 90–95.</ref> It was some 55 years after Tsongkhapa's death when eventually, the monastic authorities saw compelling evidence that convinced them the child in question was indeed the incarnation of their founder. They felt obliged to break with their own tradition and in 1487, the boy was renamed [[Gendun Gyatso]] and installed at Tashilhunpo as Gendun Drup's tulku, albeit informally.<ref name=mull956>Mullin 2001, pp. 95–96.</ref>

Gendun Gyatso died in 1542 and the lineage of Dalai Lama tulkus finally became firmly established when the third incarnation, [[3rd Dalai Lama|Sonam Gyatso]] (1543–1588), came forth. He made himself known as the ''tulku'' of Gendun Gyatso and was formally recognised and enthroned at Drepung in 1546.<ref>Mullin 2001, p. 137–8.</ref> When Gendun Gyatso was given the titular name "Dalai Lama" by the Tümed [[Altan Khan]] in 1578,<ref name="Tagliacozzo2015">{{cite book|author=Eric Tagliacozzo|title=Asia Inside Out: Changing Times|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rKLrBQAAQBAJ&pg=PT153|date=5 January 2015|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-96694-9}}</ref>{{rp|153}} his two predecessors were accorded the title posthumously and he became known as the third in the lineage.<ref name=rich />

=== 1st Dalai Lama ===
{{Main|1st Dalai Lama}}
The Dalai Lama lineage started from humble beginnings.<ref>Bell 1946, p. 32.</ref> 'Pema Dorje' (1391–1474), the boy who was to become the first in the line, was born in a cattle pen<ref name=norb215>Norbu 1968, p. 215.</ref> in Shabtod, [[Ü-Tsang|Tsang]] in 1391.<ref name="shak91" /> His nomad parents kept sheep and goats and lived in tents. When his father died in 1398 his mother was unable to support the young goatherd so she entrusted him to his uncle, a monk at [[Narthang Monastery|Narthang]], a major Kadampa monastery near Shigatse, for education as a Buddhist monk.<ref>Mullin 2001, pp. 52–3.</ref> Narthang ran the largest printing press in Tibet<ref>David-Neel 2007, p. 89.</ref> and its celebrated library attracted scholars and adepts from far and wide, so Pema Dorje received an education beyond the norm at the time as well as exposure to diverse spiritual schools and ideas.<ref name=mull54>Mullin 2001, p. 54.</ref> He studied Buddhist philosophy extensively and in 1405, ordained by Narthang's abbot, he took the name of Gendun Drup.<ref name=shak91 /> Soon recognised as an exceptionally gifted pupil, the abbot tutored him personally and took special interest in his progress.<ref name=mull54 /> In 12 years he passed the 12 grades of monkhood and took the highest vows.<ref name=norb215 /> After completing his intensive studies at Narthang he left to continue at specialist monasteries in Central Tibet, his grounding at Narthang was revered among many he encountered.<ref>Mullin 2001, pp. 54, 56.</ref>

In 1415 Gendun Drup met [[Tsongkhapa]], founder of the [[Gelugpa]] school, and became his student; their meeting was of decisive historical and political significance as he was later to be known as the [[1st Dalai Lama]].<ref>Dhondub 1984, p. 3.</ref> When eventually Tsongkhapa's successor the [[Khedrup Gelek Pelzang, 1st Panchen Lama|Panchen Lama Khedrup Je]] died, Gendun Drup became the leader of the Gelugpa.<ref name=norb215 /> He rose to become Abbot of Drepung, the greatest Gelugpa monastery, outside Lhasa.<ref name=TN1 />

It was mainly due to Gendun Drup's energy and ability that Tsongkhapa's new school grew into an expanding order capable of competing with others on an equal footing.<ref name=snel182>Snellgrove & Richardson 1986, p. 182.</ref> Taking advantage of good relations with the nobility and a lack of determined opposition from rival orders, on the very edge of Karma Kagyu-dominated territory he founded Tashilhunpo Monastery at Shigatse.<ref name=snel182 /> He was based there, as its Abbot, from its founding in 1447 until his death.<ref>Richardson 1984, p. 40.</ref> Tashilhunpo, 'Mountain of Blessings', became the fourth great Gelugpa monastery in Tibet, after [[Ganden]], Drepung and Sera had all been founded in Tsongkhapa's time.<ref name=norb216 /> It later became the seat of the [[Panchen Lamas]].<ref name=bell33>Bell 1946, p. 33.</ref>
By establishing it at Shigatse in the middle of Tsang, he expanded the Gelugpa sphere of influence, and his own, from the Lhasa region of Ü to this province, which was the stronghold of the [[Karma Kagyu]] school and their patrons, the rising [[Tsangpa]] dynasty.<ref name=norb216 /><ref>Smith 1997, p. 101.</ref> Tashilhunpo was destined to become 'Southern Tibet's greatest monastic university'<ref name=mull242>Mullin 1983, p. 242.</ref> with a complement of 3,000 monks.<ref name="shak91" />

Gendun Drup was said to be the greatest scholar-saint ever produced by [[Narthang Monastery]]<ref name=mull242 /> and became 'the single most important lama in Tibet'.<ref>Mullin 2001, p. 52.</ref> Through hard work he became a leading lama, known as 'Perfecter of the Monkhood', 'with a host of disciples'.<ref name=bell33 /> Famed for his Buddhist scholarship he was also referred to as ''Panchen Gendun Drup'', 'Panchen' being an honorary title designating 'great scholar'.<ref name=shak91 /> By the great [[Jonangpa]] master Bodong Chokley Namgyal<ref>[[:de:Bodong Chogle Namgyel]]</ref> he was accorded the honorary title ''Tamchey Khyenpa'' meaning "The Omniscient One", an appellation that was later assigned to all Dalai Lama incarnations.<ref>Mullin 2001, pp. 58–9.</ref>

At the age of 50, he entered meditation retreat at [[Narthang Monastery|Narthang]]. As he grew older, [[Karma Kagyu]] adherents, finding their sect was losing too many recruits to the monkhood to burgeoning [[Gelugpa]] monasteries, tried to contain Gelug expansion by launching military expeditions against them in the region.<ref>Mullin 2001, p. 60.</ref> This led to decades of military and political power struggles between [[Tsangpa]] dynasty forces and others across central Tibet.<ref>Dhondup 1984, p. 4.</ref> In an attempt to ameliorate these clashes, from his retreat Gendun Drup issued a poem of advice to his followers advising restraint from responding to violence with more violence and to practice compassion and patience instead. The poem, entitled ''Shar Gang Rima'', "The Song of the Eastern Snow Mountains", became one of his most enduring popular literary works.<ref>Mullin 2001, p. 61.</ref>

Although he was born in a cattle pen to be a simple goatherd, Gendun Drup rose to become one of the most celebrated and respected teachers in Tibet and Central Asia. His spiritual accomplishments brought him substantial donations from devotees which he used to build and furnish new monasteries, to print and distribute Buddhist texts and to maintain monks and meditators.<ref>Mullin 2001, p. 6.9</ref> At last, at the age of 84, older than any of his 13 successors, in 1474 he went on foot to visit [[Narthang Monastery]] on a final teaching tour. Returning to Tashilhunpo<ref>Mullin 2001, p. 69–70.</ref> he died 'in a blaze of glory, recognised as having attained Buddhahood'.<ref name=bell33 />

His mortal remains were interred in a bejewelled silver [[stupa]] at [[Tashi Lhunpo Monastery]], which survived the [[Cultural Revolution]] and can still be seen.<ref name=mull87 />

=== 2nd Dalai Lama ===
{{Main|2nd Dalai Lama}}
Like the Kadampa, the [[Gelugpa]] eschewed the ''tulku'' system.<ref>Mullin 2001, pp. 87, 94–5.</ref> After Gendun Drup died, however, a boy called Sangyey Pel born to Nyngma adepts at Yolkar in [[Ü-Tsang|Tsang]],<ref name=shak91 /><ref>Mullin 2001, p. 89.</ref> declared himself at 3 to be "Gendun Drup" and asked to be 'taken home' to Tashilhunpo. He spoke in mystical verses, quoted classical texts out of the blue<ref>Mullin 2001, pp. 90–93.</ref> and said he was [[Dromtönpa]], an earlier incarnation of the Dalai Lamas.<ref>Mullin 2001, p. 90.</ref> When he saw monks from Tashilhunpo he greeted the disciples of the late Gendun Drup by name.<ref>Mullin 2001, p. 95.</ref> The Gelugpa elders had to break with tradition and recognised him as Gendun Drup's ''tulku''.<ref name=mull956 />

He was then 8, but until his 12th year his father took him on his teachings and retreats, training him in all the family [[Nyingma]] lineages.<ref>Mullin 2001, p. 94.</ref> At 12 he was installed at Tashilhunpo as Gendun Drup's incarnation, ordained, enthroned and renamed [[Gendun Gyatso Palzangpo]] (1475–1542).<ref name=mull956 />

Tutored personally by the abbot he made rapid progress and from 1492 at 17 he was requested to teach all over Tsang, where thousands gathered to listen and give obeisance, including senior scholars and abbots.<ref>Mullin 2001, pp. 97–8.</ref> In 1494, at 19, he met some opposition from the Tashilhunpo establishment when tensions arose over conflicts between advocates of the two types of succession, the traditional abbatial election through merit, and incarnation. Although he had served for some years as Tashilhunpo's abbot, he therefore moved to central Tibet, where he was invited to Drepung and where his reputation as a brilliant young teacher quickly grew.<ref>Kapstein 2006, p. 129.</ref><ref>Mullin 2001, 99–100</ref> He was accorded all the loyalty and devotion that Gendun Drup had earned and the Gelug school remained as united as ever.<ref name=norb216 /> This move had the effect of shifting central Gelug authority back to Lhasa. Under his leadership, the sect went on growing in size and influence<ref name=norb217 /> and with its appeal of simplicity, devotion and austerity its lamas were asked to mediate in disputes between other rivals.<ref>Snelling & Richardson 1986, pp. 182–3.</ref>

Gendun Gyatso's popularity in Ü-Tsang grew as he went on pilgrimage, travelling, teaching and studying from masters such as the adept Khedrup Norzang Gyatso in the Olklha mountains.<ref>Mullin 2001, pp. 100–103.</ref> He also stayed in [[Kongpo]] and Dagpo<ref>[[:de:Dagpo (Region)]]</ref> and became known all over Tibet.<ref name="laird139" /> He spent his winters in Lhasa, writing commentaries and the rest of the year travelling and teaching many thousands of monks and lay people.<ref>Mullin 2001, p. 105.</ref>

In 1509 he moved to southern Tibet to build Chokorgyel Monastery near the 'Oracle Lake', [[Lhamo Latso]],<ref name="laird139" /> completing it by 1511.<ref name=mull111>Mullin 2001, p. 111.</ref> That year he saw visions in the lake and 'empowered' it to impart clues to help identify incarnate lamas. All Dalai Lamas from the 3rd on were found with the help of such visions granted to regents.<ref name="laird139" /><ref>Mullin 2001, pp. 107–9.</ref> By now widely regarded as one of Tibet's greatest saints and scholars<ref>Mullin 2001, p. 109.</ref> he was invited back to Tashilhunpo. On his return in 1512, he was given the residence built for Gendun Drup, to be occupied later by the [[Panchen Lamas]].<ref name=shak91 /> He was made abbot of Tashilhunpo<ref>Stein 1972, p. 84.</ref> and stayed there teaching in Tsang for 9 months.<ref>Mullin 2001, pp. 109–110.</ref>

Gendun Gyatso continued to travel widely and teach while based at Tibet's largest monastery, Drepung and became known as 'Drepung Lama',<ref name=norb217>Norbu 1984, p. 217/</ref> his fame and influence spreading all over Central Asia as the best students from hundreds of lesser monasteries in Asia were sent to Drepung for education.<ref name=mull111 />

Throughout Gendun Gyatso's life, the Gelugpa were opposed and suppressed by older rivals, particularly the [[Karma Kagyu]] and their Ringpung clan patrons from Tsang, who felt threatened by their loss of influence.<ref name=dhon456>Dhondup 1984, pp. 4–6.</ref> In 1498 the Ringpung army captured Lhasa and banned the Gelugpa annual New Year [[Monlam Prayer Festival]]<ref name=dhon456 /> started by Tsongkhapa for world peace and prosperity.<ref name=mull112>Mullin 2001, p. 112.</ref> Gendun Gyatso was promoted to abbot of Drepung in 1517<ref name=mull111 /> and that year Ringpung forces were forced to withdraw from Lhasa.<ref name=dhon456 /><ref>Shakabpa 1984, p. 90.</ref> Gendun Gyatso then went to the ''Gongma'' (King) [[Drakpa Jungne]]<ref>Shakabpa 1984, pp. 89–92.</ref> to obtain permission for the festival to be held again.<ref name=mull112 /> The next New Year, the ''Gongma'' was so impressed by Gendun Gyatso's performance leading the Festival that he sponsored construction of a large new residence for him at Drepung, 'a monastery within a monastery'.<ref name=mull112 /> It was called the [[Ganden Phodrang]], a name later adopted by the Tibetan Government,<ref name=shak91 /> and it served as home for Dalai Lamas until the Fifth moved to the [[Potala Palace]] in 1645.

In 1525, already abbot of Chokhorgyel, Drepung and Tashilhunpo, he was made abbot of Sera monastery as well, and seeing the number of monks was low he worked to increase it.<ref name=mull113>Mullin 2001, p. 113.</ref>
Based at Drepung in winter and Chokorgyel in summer, he spent his remaining years in composing commentaries, regional teaching tours, visiting Tashilhunpo from time to time and acting as abbot of these four great monasteries.<ref name=mull113 /> As abbot, he made Drepung the largest monastery in the whole of Tibet.<ref name=sr183>Snellgrove & Richardson 1986, p. 183.</ref> He attracted many students and disciples 'from Kashmir to China'<ref name=mull113 /> as well as major patrons and disciples such as ''Gongma'' Nangso Donyopa of Droda who built a monastery at Zhekar Dzong in his honour and invited him to name it and be its spiritual guide.<ref>Mullin 2001, pp. 114–5.</ref>

''Gongma'' Gyaltsen Palzangpo of Khyomorlung at Tolung and his Queen Sangyey Paldzomma also became his favourite devoted lay patrons and disciples in the 1530s and he visited their area to carry out rituals as 'he chose it for his next place of rebirth'.<ref name=mull1137>Mullin 2001, pp. 113, 117.</ref> He died in meditation at Drepung in 1542 at 67 and his reliquary stupa was constructed at Khyomorlung.<ref name=mull120>Mullin 2001, p. 120.</ref> It was said that, by the time he died, through his disciples and their students, his personal influence covered the whole of Buddhist Central Asia where 'there was nobody of any consequence who did not know of him'.<ref name=mull120 />

=== 3rd Dalai Lama ===
{{Main|3rd Dalai Lama}}
The Third Dalai Lama, [[3rd Dalai Lama|Sonam Gyatso]] (1543–1588) was born in Tolung, near Lhasa,<ref name=shak92>Shakabpa 1984, p. 92.</ref>
as predicted by his predecessor.<ref name=mull1137 /> Claiming he was Gendun Gyatso and readily recalling events from his previous life, he was recognised as the incarnation, named 'Sonam Gyatso' and installed at Drepung, where 'he quickly excelled his teachers in knowledge and wisdom and developed extraordinary powers'.<ref>Norbu 1986, p. 217.</ref> Unlike his predecessors, he came from a noble family, connected with the [[Sakya]] and the [[Phagmo Drupa]] (Karma Kagyu affiliated) dynasties,<ref name=sr183 /> and it is to him that the effective conversion of Mongolia to Buddhism is due.<ref name="bell33" />

A brilliant scholar and teacher,<ref name=rich41>Richardson 1984, p. 41.</ref> he had the spiritual maturity to be made Abbot of Drepung,<ref>Dhondup 1984, p. 6.</ref> taking responsibility for the material and spiritual well-being of Tibet's largest monastery at the age of nine. At 10 he led the [[Monlam Prayer Festival]], giving daily discourses to the assembly of all Gelugpa monks.<ref>Mullin 2001, p. 141.</ref> His influence grew so quickly that soon the monks at Sera Monastery also made him their Abbot<ref name="laird139" /> and his mediation was being sought to prevent fighting between political power factions. At 16, in 1559, he was invited to [[Nêdong (village)|Nedong]] by King [[Ngawang Tashi Drakpa]], a [[Karma Kagyu]] supporter, and became his personal teacher. At 17, when fighting broke out in Lhasa between Gelug and Kagyu parties and efforts by local lamas to mediate failed, Sonam Gyatso negotiated a peaceful settlement. At 19, when the [[Lhasa River|Kyichu River]] burst its banks and flooded Lhasa, he led his followers to rescue victims and repair the dykes. He then instituted a custom whereby on the last day of [[Monlam]], all the monks would work on strengthening the flood defences.<ref name=shak92 /> Gradually, he was shaping himself into a national leader.<ref>Dhondup 1984, p. 7.</ref> His popularity and renown became such that in 1564 when the Nedong King died, it was Sonam Gyatso at the age of 21 who was requested to lead his funeral rites, rather than his own Kagyu lamas.<ref name=laird139 />

Required to travel and teach without respite after taking full ordination in 1565, he still maintained extensive meditation practices in the hours before dawn and again at the end of the day.<ref name=mull142>Mullin 2001, p. 142.</ref> In 1569, at age 26, he went to Tashilhunpo to study the layout and administration of the monastery built by his predecessor Gendun Drup. Invited to become the Abbot he declined, already being Abbot of Drepung and Sera, but left his deputy there in his stead.<ref>Shakabpa 1984, p. 93.</ref> From there he visited [[Narthang Monastery|Narthang]], the first monastery of Gendun Drup and gave numerous discourses and offerings to the monks in gratitude.<ref name=mull142 />

Meanwhile, [[Altan Khan]], chief of all the Mongol tribes near China's borders, had heard of Sonam Gyatso's spiritual prowess and repeatedly invited him to Mongolia.<ref name=sr183 /> By 1571, when Altan Khan received a title of Shunyi Wang (King) from the [[Ming dynasty]] of China<ref name="Dardess2012_p16">{{cite book|author=John W.

They met in an atmosphere of intense reverence and devotion<ref name=sr184>Snellgrove & Richardson 1984, p. 184.</ref> and their meeting resulted in the re-establishment of strong Tibet-Mongolia relations after a gap of 200 years.<ref name=sr183 />
To Altan Khan, Sonam Gyatso identified himself as the incarnation of [[Drogön Chögyal Phagpa]], and Altan Khan as that of [[Kubilai Khan]], thus placing the Khan as heir to the [[Chingizid]] lineage whilst securing his patronage.<ref name="Smith 1996, p. 106">Smith 1996, p. 106.</ref>
Altan Khan and his followers quickly adopted Buddhism as their state religion, replacing the prohibited traditional [[Shamanism]].<ref name=rich41 />
Mongol law was reformed to accord with Tibetan Buddhist law. From this time Buddhism spread rapidly across Mongolia<ref name="Smith 1996, p. 106" /> and soon the Gelugpa had won the spiritual allegiance of most of the Mongolian tribes.<ref name=rich41 />
As proposed by Sonam Gyatso, Altan Khan sponsored the building of Thegchen Chonkhor Monastery at the site of Sonam Gyatso's open-air teachings given to the whole Mongol population. He also called Sonam Gyatso "Dalai", Mongolian for 'Gyatso' (Ocean).<ref>Shakabpa 1984, pp. 94–95.</ref>

The name "Dalai Lama", by which the lineage later became known throughout the non-Tibetan world, was thus established and it was applied to the first two incarnations retrospectively.<ref name=rich />

Returning eventually to Tibet by a roundabout route and invited to stay and teach all along the way, in 1580 Sonam Gyatso was in [[Hohhot]] [or [[Ningxia]]], not far from Beijing, when the Chinese Emperor invited him to his court.<ref>Smith 1996, p. 104.</ref><ref name=shak96>Shakabpa 1986, p. 96.</ref>
By then he had established a religious empire of such proportions that it was unsurprising the Emperor wanted to invite him and grant him a diploma.<ref name=sr184 />
At the request of the Ningxia Governor he had been teaching large gatherings of people from [[East Turkestan]], Mongolia and nearby areas of China, with interpreters provided by the governor for each language. While there, a [[Ming]] court envoy came with gifts and a request to visit the [[Wanli Emperor]] but he declined having already agreed to visit Eastern Tibet next. Once there, in [[Kham]], he founded two more great Gelugpa monasteries, the first in 1580 at [[Lithang]] where he left his representative before going on to [[Chamdo Monastery]] where he resided and was made Abbot. Through Altan Khan, the 3rd Dalai Lama requested to pay tribute to the Emperor of China in order to raise his State Tutor ranking, the Ming imperial court of China agreed with the request.<ref name="Wang尼玛坚赞1997">{{cite book|author1=Jiawei Wang|author2=尼玛坚赞|title=The Historical Status of China's Tibet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ak3SQTVS7acC&pg=PA44|year=1997|publisher=五洲传播出版社|isbn=978-7-80113-304-5|pages=44–}}</ref> In 1582, he heard Altan Khan had died and invited by his son Dhüring Khan he decided to return to Mongolia. Passing through [[Amdo]], he founded a second great monastery, [[Kumbum Monastery|Kumbum]], at the birthplace of [[Tsongkhapa]] near [[Chinghai Lake|Kokonor]].<ref name=shak96 /> Further on, he was asked to adjudicate on border disputes between Mongolia and China. It was the first time a Dalai Lama had exercised such political authority.<ref name=norb220>Norbu 1986, p. 220.</ref>
Arriving in Mongolia in 1585, he stayed 2 years with Dhüring Khan, teaching Buddhism to his people<ref name=shak96 /> and converting more Mongol princes and their tribes. Receiving a second invitation from the Emperor in Beijing he accepted, but died en route in 1588.<ref name=Laird147>Laird 2006, p. 147.</ref>

For a lifetime of only 45 years, his accomplishments were impressive and some of the most important ones were due to his relationship with Altan Khan.<ref name=Laird147 /> As he was dying, his Mongolian converts urged him not to leave them, as they needed his continuing religious leadership. He promised them he would be incarnated next in Mongolia, as a Mongolian.<ref name=norb220 />

=== 4th Dalai Lama ===
{{Main|4th Dalai Lama}}
The Fourth Dalai Lama, [[Yonten Gyatso]] (1589–1617) was a Mongolian, the great-grandson of [[Altan Khan]]<ref name="Dardess2012">{{cite book |author=John W.

He studied at Drepung and became its abbot but being a non-Tibetan he met with opposition from some Tibetans, especially the Karma Kagyu who felt their position was threatened by these emerging events; there were several attempts to remove him from power.<ref>Mullin 2001, p. 172–181.</ref> Yonten Gyatso died at the age of 27 under suspicious circumstances and his chief attendant [[Sonam Rapten]] went on to discover the 5th Dalai Lama, became his ''chagdzo'' or manager and after 1642 he went on to be his regent, the Desi.<ref>Mullin 2001, p. 182.</ref>

The death of the Fourth Dalai Lama in 1617 led to open conflict breaking out between various parties.<ref name=TN2 /> Firstly, the [[Tsangpa]] dynasty, rulers of Central Tibet from Shigatse, supporters of the [[Karmapa]] school and rivals to the [[Gelugpa]], forbade the search for his incarnation.<ref name=SK>{{cite journal|author1=Karmay, Samten C.|title=The Great Fifth|journal=The Newsletter|year=2005|volume=Winter 2005|issue=39|page=2|url=http://www.iias.nl/sites/default/files/IIAS_NL39_1213.pdf|access-date=14 June 2015|series=Research|publisher=International Institute for Asian Studies|location=Leiden, the Netherlands|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141207235713/http://www.iias.nl/sites/default/files/IIAS_NL39_1213.pdf|archive-date=7 December 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> However, in 1618 [[Sonam Rapten|Sonam Rabten]], the former attendant of the 4th Dalai Lama who had become the [[Ganden Phodrang]] treasurer, secretly identified the child,<ref name=shak101>Shakabpa 1984, pp. 101–102.</ref> who had been born to the noble Zahor family at Tagtse castle, south of Lhasa. Then, the [[Panchen Lama]], in Shigatse, negotiated the lifting of the ban, enabling the boy to be recognised as [[Lobsang Gyatso]], the 5th Dalai Lama.<ref name=SK />

Also in 1618, the Tsangpa King, Karma Puntsok Namgyal, whose Mongol patron was [[Choghtu Khong Tayiji]] of the [[Khalkha Mongols]], attacked the Gelugpa in Lhasa to avenge an earlier snub and established two military bases there to control the monasteries and the city. This caused Sonam Rabten who became the 5th Dalai Lama's ''changdzo'' or manager,<ref>Mullin 2001, p. 198.</ref> to seek more active Mongol patronage and military assistance for the Gelugpa while the Fifth was still a boy.<ref name=TN2 /> So, in 1620, Mongol troops allied to the Gelugpa who had camped outside Lhasa suddenly attacked and destroyed the two Tsangpa camps and drove them out of Lhasa, enabling the Dalai Lama to be brought out of hiding and publicly enthroned there in 1622.<ref name=shak101 />

In fact, throughout the 5th's minority, it was the influential and forceful Sonam Rabten who inspired the [[Dzungars|Dzungar Mongols]] to defend the Gelugpa by attacking their enemies. These enemies included other Mongol tribes who supported the Tsangpas, the Tsangpa themselves and their Bönpo allies in Kham who had also opposed and persecuted Gelugpas. Ultimately, this strategy led to the destruction of the Tsangpa dynasty, the defeat of the Karmapas and their other allies and the Bönpos, by armed forces from the Lhasa valley aided by their Mongol allies, paving the way for Gelugpa political and religious hegemony in Central Tibet.<ref name=SK /> Apparently by general consensus, by virtue of his position as the Dalai Lama's ''changdzo'' (chief attendant, minister), after the Dalai Lama became absolute ruler of Tibet in 1642 Sonam Rabten became the "''Desi''" or "Viceroy", in fact, the ''de facto'' regent or day-to-day ruler of Tibet's governmental affairs. During these years and for the rest of his life (he died in 1658), "there was little doubt that politically Sonam Chophel [Rabten] was more powerful than the Dalai Lama".<ref name=GM199>Mullin 2001, p. 199.</ref> As a young man, being 22 years his junior, the Dalai Lama addressed him reverentially as "''Zhalngo''", meaning "the Presence".<ref>Karmay 2014, p. 4.</ref>

During the 1630s Tibet was deeply entangled in rivalry, evolving power struggles and conflicts, not only between the Tibetan religious sects but also between the rising [[Manchu people|Manchus]] and the various rival [[Mongol]] and [[Oirats|Oirat]] factions, who were also vying for supremacy amongst themselves and on behalf of the religious sects they patronised.<ref name=TN2 /> For example, [[Ligdan Khan]] of the [[Chahars]], a Mongol subgroup who supported the Tsang Karmapas, after retreating from advancing Manchu armies headed for [[Qinghai|Kokonor]] intending destroy the [[Gelug]]. He died on the way, in 1634<ref>Michael Weiers, ''Geschichte der Mongolen'', Stuttgart 2004, p. 182f</ref> but his vassal [[Choghtu Khong Tayiji]], continued to advance against the Gelugpas, even having his own son Arslan killed after Arslan changed sides, submitted to the Dalai Lama and become a Gelugpa monk.<ref>Shakabpa 1984, p. 104.</ref> By the mid-1630s, thanks again to the efforts of Sonam Rabten,<ref name=SK /> the [[5th Dalai Lama]] had found a powerful new patron in Güshi Khan of the [[Khoshut]] Mongols, a subgroup of the [[Dzungars]], who had recently migrated to the Kokonor area from [[Dzungaria]].<ref name=TN2 /> He attacked [[Choghtu Khong Tayiji]] at Kokonor in 1637 and defeated and killed him, thus eliminating the Tsangpa and the Karmapa's main Mongol patron and protector.<ref name=TN2 />

Next, Donyo Dorje, the [[Bönpo]] king of Beri in [[Kham]] was found writing to the Tsangpa king in Shigatse to propose a co-ordinated 'pincer attack' on the Lhasa Gelugpa monasteries from east and west, seeking to utterly destroy them once and for all.<ref>Shakabpa 1984, pp. 105–106.</ref> The intercepted letter was sent to Güshi Khan who used it as a pretext to invade central Tibet in 1639 to attack them both, the Bönpo and the Tsangpa. By 1641 he had defeated Donyo Dorje and his allies in Kham and then he marched on Shigatse where after laying siege to their strongholds he defeated [[Karma Tenkyong]], broke the power of the Tsang Karma Kagyu in 1642 and ended the Tsangpa dynasty.<ref>Shakabpa 1967, p. 105–111.</ref>

Güshi Khan's attack on the Tsangpa was made on the orders of [[Sonam Rapten]] while being publicly and robustly opposed by the Dalai Lama, who, as a matter of conscience, out of compassion and his vision of tolerance for other religious schools, refused to give permission for more warfare in his name after the defeat of the Beri king.<ref name=GM199 /><ref name=shak106>Shakabpa 1984, p. 106–110.</ref> Sonam Rabten deviously went behind his master's back to encourage Güshi Khan, to facilitate his plans and to ensure the attacks took place;<ref name=SK /> for this defiance of his master's wishes, Rabten was severely rebuked by the 5th Dalai Lama.<ref name=shak106 />

After Desi [[Sonam Rapten]] died in 1658, the following year the 5th Dalai Lama appointed his younger brother [[Depa Norbu]] (aka Nangso Norbu) as his successor.<ref>Karmay 2014, p. 403.</ref> However, after a few months, Norbu betrayed him and led a rebellion against the Ganden Phodrang Government. With his accomplices he seized Samdruptse fort at Shigatse and tried to raise a rebel army from Tsang and Bhutan, but the Dalai Lama skilfully foiled his plans without any fighting taking place and Norbu had to flee.<ref>Karmay 2014, pp. 409–425.</ref> Four other Desis were appointed after Depa Norbu: Trinle Gyatso, Lozang Tutop, Lozang Jinpa and [[Sangye Gyatso]].<ref>Shakabpa 2010, p. 1133.</ref>

==== Re-unification of Tibet ====
Having thus defeated all the Gelugpa's rivals and resolved all regional and sectarian conflicts Güshi Khan became the undisputed patron of a unified Tibet and acted as a "Protector of the Gelug",<ref>René Grousset, ''The Empire of the Steppes'', New Brunswick 1970, p. 522.</ref> establishing the [[Khoshut Khanate]] which covered almost the entire Tibetan plateau, an area corresponding roughly to '[[Greater Tibet]]' including [[Kham]] and [[Amdo]], as claimed by exiled groups (see maps).

In this way, Güshi Khan established the Fifth Dalai Lama as the highest spiritual and political authority in Tibet. 'The Great Fifth' became the temporal ruler of Tibet in 1642 and from then on the rule of the Dalai Lama lineage over some, all or most of Tibet lasted with few breaks for the next 317 years, until 1959, when the [[14th Dalai Lama]] fled to India.<ref>{{harv|Buswell|Lopez|2014|p=210}}</ref> In 1645, the Great Fifth began the construction of the [[Potala Palace]] in Lhasa.<ref name=mull201>Mullin 2001, p. 201.</ref>

Güshi Khan died in 1655 and was succeeded by his descendants [[Dayan Khan (Khoshut)|Dayan]], [[Tenzin Dalai Khan]] and Tenzin Wangchuk Khan. However, Güshi Khan's other eight sons had settled in Amdo but fought amongst themselves over territory so the Fifth Dalai Lama sent governors to rule them in 1656 and 1659, thereby bringing [[Amdo]] and thus the whole of Greater Tibet under his personal rule and Gelugpa control. The Mongols in Amdo became absorbed and Tibetanised.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Karmay, Samten C.|title=The Great Fifth|journal=The Newsletter|year=2005|volume=Winter 2005|issue=39|page=2|url=http://www.iias.nl/sites/default/files/IIAS_NL39_1213.pdf|access-date=14 June 2015|series=Research|publisher=International Institute for Asian Studies|location=Leiden, the Netherlands|quote=Over time the region's Mongols were completely Tibetanized but continued to enjoy prestige among the Tibetans as Gushri Khan's descendants and played a significant role in the Gelug Order's expansion in Amdo.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141207235713/http://www.iias.nl/sites/default/files/IIAS_NL39_1213.pdf|archive-date=7 December 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==== Visit to Beijing ====
In 1636 the [[Manchu people|Manchus]] proclaimed their dynasty as the [[Qing dynasty]] and by 1644 they had completed [[Qing conquest of the Ming|their conquest of China]] under the [[prince regent]] [[Dorgon]].<ref>{{Cite book |doi = 10.1002/9781118455074.wbeoe287|chapter = China, imperial: 8. Qing or Manchu dynasty period, 1636-1911|title = The Encyclopedia of Empire|pages = 1–13|year = 2016|last1 = Hang|first1 = Henry Choi Sze|isbn = 9781118455074}}</ref> The following year their forces approached [[Amdo]] on northern Tibet, causing the Oirat and Khoshut Mongols there to submit in 1647 and send tribute. In 1648, after quelling a rebellion of Tibetans of Kansu-Xining, the Qing invited the Fifth Dalai Lama to visit their court at Beijing since they wished to engender Tibetan influence in their dealings with the Mongols. The Qing were aware the Dalai Lama had extraordinary influence with the Mongols and saw relations with the Dalai Lama as a means to facilitate submission of the [[Khalka Mongols]], traditional patrons of the [[Karma Kagyu]] sect. Similarly, since the Tibetan Gelugpa were keen to revive a [[priest-patron]] relationship with the dominant power in China and Inner Asia, the Qing invitation was accepted. After five years of complex diplomatic negotiations about whether the emperor or his representatives should meet the Dalai Lama inside or outside the Great Wall, when the meeting would be astrologically favourable, how it would be conducted and so on, it eventually took place in Beijing in 1653. The Shunzhi Emperor was then 16 years old, having in the meantime ascended the throne in 1650 after the death of Dorgon. For the Qing, although the Dalai Lama was not required to [[kowtow]] to the emperor, who rose from his throne and advanced 30 feet to meet him, the significance of the visit was that of nominal political submission by the Dalai Lama since Inner Asian heads of state did not travel to meet each other but sent envoys. For Tibetan Buddhist historians however it was interpreted as the start of an era of independent rule of the Dalai Lamas, and of Qing patronage alongside that of the Mongols.<ref>Smith 1997, pp. 108–113.</ref>

When the 5th Dalai Lama returned, he was granted by the emperor of China a golden seal of authority and golden sheets with texts written in Manchu, Tibetan and Chinese languages.<ref name="陈庆英2005_p41">{{cite book |author=陈庆英 |title=达赖喇嘛转世及历史定制英 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=haMIsdC3iZwC&pg=PA41 |year=2005 |publisher=五洲传播出版社 |isbn = 978-7-5085-0745-3 |pages=41–}}</ref><ref name=K309>Karmay 2014, p. 309.</ref> The 5th Dalai Lama wanted to use the golden seal of authority right away.<ref name="陈庆英2005_p41" /> However, Lobzang Gyatsho noted that "The Tibetan version of the inscription of the seal was translated by a Mongolian translator but was not a good translation". After correction, it read: "The one who resides in the Western peaceful and virtuous paradise is unalterable Vajradhara, Ocen Lama, unifier of the doctrines of the Buddha for all beings under the sky". The words of the diploma ran: "Proclamation, to let all the people of the western hemisphere know".<ref name=K309 /> Tibetan historian Nyima Gyaincain points out that based on the texts written on golden sheets, Dalai Lama was only a subordinate of the Emperor of China.<ref name="王家伟尼玛坚赞1997">{{cite book|author1=王家伟|author2=尼玛坚赞|title=中国西藏的历史地位|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eWCa0NSILSsC&pg=PA38|year=1997|publisher=五洲传播出版社|isbn=978-7-80113-303-8|pages=38–}}</ref>

However, despite such patronising attempts by Chinese officials and historians to symbolically show for the record that they held political influence over Tibet, the Tibetans themselves did not accept any such symbols imposed on them by the Chinese with this kind of motive. For example, concerning the above-mentioned 'golden seal', the Fifth Dalai Lama comments in ''Dukula'', his autobiography, on leaving China after this courtesy visit to the emperor in 1653, that "the emperor made his men bring a golden seal for me that had three vertical lines in three parallel scripts: Chinese, Mongolian and Tibetan". He also criticised the words carved on this gift as being faultily translated into Tibetan, writing that "The Tibetan version of the inscription of the seal was translated by a Mongol translator but was not a good translation".<ref name=K309/> Furthermore, when he arrived back in Tibet, he discarded the emperor's famous golden seal and made a new one for important state usage, writing in his autobiography: "Leaving out the Chinese characters that were on the seal given by the emperor, a new seal was carved for stamping documents that dealt with territorial issues. The first imprint of the seal was offered with prayers to the image of Lokeshvara ...".<ref>Karmay 2014, p. 402.</ref>

==== Relations with the Qing dynasty ====
The 17th-century struggles for domination between the Manchu-led Qing dynasty and the various Mongol groups spilled over to involve Tibet because of the Fifth Dalai Lama's strong influence over the Mongols as a result of their general adoption of Tibetan Buddhism and their consequent deep loyalty to the Dalai Lama as their guru. Until 1674, the Fifth Dalai Lama had mediated in [[Dzungar people|Dzungar Mongol]] affairs whenever they required him to do so, and the [[Kangxi Emperor]], who had succeeded the Shunzhi Emperor in 1661, would accept and confirm his decisions automatically. For the Kangxi Emperor however, the alliance between the Dzungar Mongols and the Tibetans was unsettling because he feared it had the potential to unite all the other Mongol tribes together against the Qing Empire, including those tribes who had already submitted. Therefore, in 1674, the Kangxi Emperor, annoyed by the Fifth's less than full cooperation in quelling a rebellion against the Qing in [[Yunnan]], ceased deferring to him as regards Mongol affairs and started dealing with them directly.<ref name=TN6>Smith 1997, pp. 116–117.</ref>

In the same year, 1674, the Dalai Lama, then at the height of his powers and conducting a foreign policy independent of the Qing, caused Mongol troops to occupy the border post of [[Dartsedo]] between Kham and Sichuan, further annoying the Kangxi Emperor who (according to Smith) already considered Tibet as part of the Qing Empire. It also increased Qing suspicion about Tibetan relations with the Mongol groups and led him to seek strategic opportunities to oppose and undermine Mongol influence in Tibet and eventually, within 50 years, to defeat the Mongols militarily and to establish the Qing as sole 'patrons and protectors' of Tibet in their place.<ref name=TN6 />

==== Cultural development ====
The time of the Fifth Dalai Lama, who reigned from 1642 to 1682 and founded the government known as the [[Ganden Phodrang]], was a period of rich cultural development.<ref>Snellgrove & Richardson 1968, p. 197.</ref> His reign and that of [[Desi Sangye Gyatso]] are noteworthy for the upsurge in literary activity and of cultural and economic life that occurred. The same goes for the great increase in the number of foreign visitors thronging Lhasa during the period as well as for the number of inventions and institutions that are attributed to the 'Great Fifth', as the Tibetans refer to him.<ref>Stein 1972, p. 84–5.</ref> The most dynamic and prolific of the early Dalai Lamas, he composed more literary works than all the other Dalai Lamas combined. Writing on a wide variety of subjects he is specially noted for his works on history, classical Indian poetry in Sanskrit and his biographies of notable personalities of his epoch, as well as his own two autobiographies, one spiritual in nature and the other political (see [[Dalai Lama#Further reading|Further Reading]]).<ref name=mull83244>Mullin 1983, p. 244.</ref> He also taught and travelled extensively, reshaped the politics of Central Asia, unified Tibet, conceived and constructed the Potala Palace and is remembered for establishing systems of national medical care and education.<ref name=mull83244 />

==== Death of the fifth Dalai Lama ====
The Fifth Dalai Lama died in 1682. Tibetan historian Nyima Gyaincain points out that the written wills from the fifth Dalai Lama before he died explicitly said his title and authority were from the Emperor of China, and he was subordinate of the Emperor of China
.<ref name="王家伟尼玛坚赞1997" />

The Fifth Dalai Lama's death in 1682 was kept secret for fifteen years by his regent [[Desi Sangye Gyatso]]. He pretended the Dalai Lama was in retreat and ruled on his behalf, secretly selecting the 6th Dalai Lama and presenting him as someone else. Tibetan historian Nyima Gyaincain points out that Desi Sangye Gyatso wanted to consolidate his personal status and power by not reporting the death of the fifth Dalai Lama to the Emperor of China, and also collude with the rebellion group of the Qing dynasty, Mongol [[Dzungar people|Dzungar]] tribe in order to counter influence from another Mongol [[Khoshut]] tribe in Tibet. Being afraid of prosecution by the Kangxi Emperor of China, Desi Sangye Gyatso explained with fear and trepidation the reason behind his action to the Emperor. In 1705, Desi Sangye Gyatso was killed by [[Lha-bzang Khan]] of the Mongol [[Khoshut]] tribe because of his actions including his illegal action of selecting the 6th Dalai Lama. Since the Kangxi Emperor was not happy about Desi Sangye Gyatso's action of not reporting, the Emperor gave [[Lha-bzang Khan]] additional title and golden seal. The Kangxi Emperor also ordered [[Lha-bzang Khan]] to arrest the 6th Dalai Lama and send him to Beijing, the 6th Dalai Lama died when he was en route to Beijing.<ref name="王家伟尼玛坚赞1997" /> Journalist Thomas Laird argues that it was apparently done so that construction of the Potala Palace could be finished, and it was to prevent Tibet's neighbors, the Mongols and the Qing, from taking advantage of an interregnum in the succession of the Dalai Lamas.{{harv|Laird|2006|pp=181–182}}

=== 6th Dalai Lama ===
{{Main|6th Dalai Lama}}
The [[6th Dalai Lama|Sixth Dalai Lama]] (1683–1706) was born near [[Tawang]], now in India, and picked out in 1685 but not enthroned until 1697 when the death of the Fifth was announced. After 16 years of study as a novice monk, in 1702 in his 20th year he rejected full ordination and gave up his monk's robes and monastic life, preferring the lifestyle of a layman.<ref>Mullin 2001, pp. 245–256.</ref><ref>Karenina Kollmar-Paulenz, ''Kleine Geschichte Tibets'', München 2006, pp. 109–122.</ref>

In 1703 Güshi Khan's ruling grandson Tenzin Wangchuk Khan was murdered by his brother [[Lha-bzang Khan|Lhazang Khan]] who usurped the Khoshut's Tibetan throne, but unlike his four predecessors he started interfering directly in Tibetan affairs in Lhasa; he opposed the Fifth Dalai Lama's regent, [[Desi Sangye Gyatso]] for his deceptions and in the same year, with the support of the Kangxi Emperor, he forced him out of office. Then in 1705, he used the Sixth's escapades as an excuse to seize full control of Tibet. Most Tibetans, though, still supported their Dalai Lama despite his behaviour and deeply resented Lhazang Khan's interference. When Lhazang was requested by the Tibetans to leave Lhasa politics to them and to retire to Kokonor like his predecessors, he quit the city, but only to gather his armies in order to return, capture Lhasa militarily and assume full political control of Tibet.<ref>Smith 1997, p. 121.</ref> The regent was then murdered by Lhazang or his wife, and, in 1706 with the compliance of the Kangxi Emperor the Sixth Dalai Lama was deposed and arrested by Lhazang who considered him to be an impostor set up by the regent. [[Lhazang Khan]], now acting as the only outright foreign ruler that Tibet had ever had, then sent him to Beijing under escort to appear before the emperor but he died mysteriously on the way near [[Lake Qinghai]], ostensibly from illness.<ref>Mullin 2001, pp. 260–271.</ref><ref name="HarperCollins">Smith 1997, p. 122.</ref>

Having discredited and deposed the Sixth Dalai Lama, whom he considered an impostor, and having removed the regent, Lhazang Khan pressed the Lhasa Gelugpa lamas to endorse a new Dalai Lama in [[Tsangyang Gyatso]]'s place as the true incarnation of the Fifth. They eventually nominated one Pekar Dzinpa, a monk but also rumored to be Lhazang's son,<ref>McKay 2003, p. 569.</ref> and Lhazang had him installed as the 'real' Sixth Dalai Lama, endorsed by the [[Panchen Lama]] and named [[Yeshe Gyatso]] in 1707.<ref>Mullin 2001, p. 274.</ref> This choice was in no way accepted by the Tibetan people, however, nor by Lhazang's princely Mongol rivals in Kokonor who resented his usurpation of the [[Khoshut]] Tibetan throne as well as his meddling in Tibetan affairs. The Kangxi Emperor concurred with them, after sending investigators, initially declining to recognize [[Yeshe Gyatso]]. He did recognize him in 1710, however, after sending a Qing official party to assist Lhazang in 'restoring order'; these were the first Chinese representatives of any sort to officiate in Tibet.<ref name="HarperCollins" /> At the same time, while this puppet 'Dalai Lama' had no political power, the Kangxi Emperor secured from Lhazang Khan in return for this support the promise of regular payments of tribute; this was the first time tribute had been paid to the Manchu by the Mongols in Tibet and the first overt acknowledgment of Qing supremacy over Mongol rule in Tibet.<ref>Richardson 1984, p. 48.</ref>

=== 7th Dalai Lama ===
{{Main|7th Dalai Lama}}
In 1708, in accordance with an indication given by the [[6th Dalai Lama]] when quitting Lhasa a child called Kelzang Gyatso had been born at [[Lithang]] in eastern Tibet who was soon claimed by local Tibetans to be his incarnation. After going into hiding out of fear of Lhazang Khan, he was installed in Lithang monastery. Along with some of the Kokonor Mongol princes, rivals of Lhazang, in defiance of the situation in Lhasa the Tibetans of [[Kham]] duly recognised him as the [[Seventh Dalai Lama]] in 1712, retaining his birth-name of [[Kelzang Gyatso]]. For security reasons he was moved to [[Derge]] monastery and eventually, in 1716, now also backed and sponsored by the Kangxi Emperor of China.<ref name="Mullin 2001, p.276-281">Mullin 2001, p. 276–281.</ref> The Tibetans asked Dzungars to bring a true Dalai Lama to Lhasa, but the Manchu Chinese did not want to release Kelsan Gyatso to the Mongol Dzungars. The Regent Taktse Shabdrung and Tibetan officials then wrote a letter to the Manchu Chinese Emperor that they recognized Kelsang Gyatso as the Dalai Lama. The Emperor then granted Kelsang Gyatso a golden seal of authority.<ref name="Society">{{cite book|author=Western Shugden Society|title=A Great Deception: The Ruling Lamas' Policies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-uySE2XJVq4C&pg=PP161|publisher=Tharpa Publications US|isbn=978-0-9563918-8-9|pages=161–}}</ref> The Sixth Dalai Lama was taken to Amdo at the age of 8 to be installed in [[Kumbum Monastery]] with great pomp and ceremony.<ref name="Mullin 2001, p.276-281" />

According to Smith, the Kangxi Emperor now arranged to protect the child and keep him at Kumbum monastery in Amdo in reserve just in case his ally Lhasang Khan and his 'real' Sixth Dalai Lama, were overthrown.<ref>Smith 1997, p. 123.</ref> According to Mullin, however, the emperor's support came from genuine spiritual recognition and respect rather than being politically motivated.<ref>Mullin 2001, p. 281.</ref>

==== Dzungar invasion ====
In any case, the Kangxi Emperor took full advantage of having Kelzang Gyatso under Qing control at [[Kumbum]] after other Mongols from the [[Dzungars|Dzungar tribes]] led by [[Tsewang Rabtan]] who was related to his supposed ally [[Lhazang Khan]], deceived and betrayed the latter by invading Tibet and capturing Lhasa in 1717.<ref>Mullin 2001, p. 285–9.</ref><ref>Smith 1997, pp. 123–5.</ref>

These Dzungars, who were Buddhist, had supported the Fifth Dalai Lama and his regent. They were secretly petitioned by the Lhasa [[Gelugpa]] lamas to invade with their help in order to rid them of their foreign ruler Lhazang Khan and to replace the unpopular [[Yeshe Gyatso|Sixth Dalai Lama pretender]] with the young Kelzang Gyats. This plot suited the devious Dzungar leaders' ambitions and they were only too happy to oblige.<ref>Mullin 2001, p. 285.</ref><ref>Smith 1997, pp. 122–3.</ref> Early in 1717, after conspiring to undermine Lhazang Khan through treachery they entered Tibet from the northwest with a large army, sending a smaller force to [[Kumbum]] to collect Kelzang Gyatso and escort him to Lhasa. By the end of the year, with Tibetan connivance they had captured Lhasa, killed Lhazang and all his family and deposed [[Yeshe Gyatso]]. Their force sent to fetch Kelzang Gyatso however was intercepted and destroyed by Qing armies alerted by Lhazang. In Lhasa, the unruly Dzungar not only failed to produce the boy but also went on the rampage, looting and destroying the holy places, abusing the populace, killing hundreds of Nyingma monks, causing chaos and bloodshed and turning their Tibetan allies against them. The Tibetans were soon appealing to the Kangxi Emperor to rid them of the Dzungars.<ref>Smith 1997, pp. 123–4.</ref><ref>Mullin 2001, pp. 286–7.</ref>

When the Dzungars had first attacked, the weakened Lhazang sent word to the Qing for support and they quickly dispatched two armies to assist, the first Chinese armies ever to enter Tibet, but they arrived too late. In 1718 they were halted not far from Lhasa to be defeated and then ruthlessly annihilated by the triumphant Dzungars in the [[Battle of the Salween River]].<ref>Richardson 1984, pp. 48–9.</ref><ref name="Stein 1972, p. 85">Stein 1972, p. 85.</ref>

==== Enthronement in Lhasa ====
This humiliation only determined the Kangxi Emperor to expel the [[Dzungars]] from Tibet once and for all and he set about assembling and dispatching a much larger force to march on Lhasa, bringing the emperor's [[Trump (card games)#Metaphorical uses|trump card]] the young Kelzang Gyatso with it. On the imperial army's stately passage from [[Kumbum]] to Lhasa with the boy being welcomed adoringly at every stage, [[Khoshut]] Mongols and Tibetans were happy (and well paid) to join and swell its ranks.<ref>Mullin 2001, pp. 287–9.</ref> By the autumn of 1720 the marauding [[Dzungar people|Dzungar Mongols]] had been vanquished from Tibet and the Qing imperial forces had entered Lhasa triumphantly with the 12-year-old, acting as patrons of the Dalai Lama, liberators of Tibet, allies of the Tibetan anti-Dzungar forces led by [[Khangchenné|Kangchenas]] and [[Polhané Sönam Topgyé|Polhanas]], and allies of the [[Khoshut]] Mongol princes. The delighted Tibetans enthroned him as the [[Seventh Dalai Lama]] at the [[Potala Palace]].<ref>Smith 1997, pp. 124–5.</ref><ref>Mullin 2001, p. 289.</ref>

A new Tibetan government was established consisting of a [[Kashag]] or cabinet of Tibetan ministers headed by [[Khangchenné|Kangchenas]]. Kelzang Gyatso, too young to participate in politics, studied Buddhism. He played a symbolic role in government, and, being profoundly revered by the Mongols, he exercised much influence with the Qing who now had now taken over Tibet's [[Priest-patron|patronage and protection]] from them.<ref>Smith 1997, pp. 124–6.</ref>

==== Exile to Kham ====
Having vanquished the Dzungars, the Qing army withdrew leaving the [[Seventh Dalai Lama]] as a political figurehead and only a [[Khalkha Mongol]] as the Qing ''[[amban]]'' or representative and a garrison in Lhasa.<ref name="Mullin 2001, p.291">Mullin 2001, p. 291.</ref><ref name=TN7>Smith 1997, p. 127.</ref> After the Kangxi Emperor died in 1722 and was succeeded by his son, the [[Yongzheng Emperor]], these were also withdrawn, leaving the Tibetans [[Autonomous|to rule autonomously]] and showing the Qing were interested in an alliance, not conquest.<ref name="Mullin 2001, p.291" /><ref name=TN7 /> In 1723, however, after brutally quelling a major rebellion by zealous Tibetan patriots and disgruntled [[Khoshut]] Mongols from Amdo who attacked [[Xining]], the Qing intervened again, splitting Tibet by putting [[Amdo]] and [[Kham]] under their own more direct control.<ref>Smith 1997, pp. 125–6.</ref> Continuing Qing interference in [[Central Tibet]]an politics and religion incited an anti-Qing faction to quarrel with the Qing-sympathising Tibetan nobles in power in Lhasa, led by [[Khangchenné|Kanchenas]] who was supported by [[Pholhane|Polhanas]]. This led eventually to the murder of [[Khangchenné|Kanchenas]] in 1727 and a civil war that was resolved in 1728 with the canny [[Pholhane|Polhanas]], who had sent for Qing assistance, the victor. When the Qing forces did arrive they punished the losers and exiled the [[Seventh Dalai Lama]] to Kham, under the pretence of sending him to Beijing, because his father had assisted the defeated, anti-Qing faction. He studied and taught Buddhism there for the next seven years.<ref>Smith 1997, pp. 129–30.</ref>

==== Return to Lhasa ====
In 1735 he was allowed back to Lhasa to study and teach, but still under strict control, being mistrusted by the Qing, while [[Polhané Sönam Topgyé|Polhanas]] ruled [[Central Tibet]] under nominal Qing supervision. Meanwhile, the Qing had promoted the [[Fifth Panchen Lama]] to be a rival leader and reinstated the ''ambans'' and the Lhasa garrison. Polhanas died in 1747 and was succeeded by his son [[Gyurme Namgyal]], the last dynastic ruler of Tibet, who was far less cooperative with the Qing. On the contrary, he built a Tibetan army and started conspiring with the Dzungars to rid Tibet of Qing influence.<ref>Shakabpa 1967, pp. 147–8.</ref> In 1750, when the ''ambans'' realised this, they invited him and personally assassinated him and then, despite the Dalai Lama's attempts to calm the angered populace a vengeful Tibetan mob assassinated the ''ambans'' in turn, along with most of their escort.<ref>Smith 1997, p. 130–132.</ref>

==== Restoration as Tibet's political leader ====
The Qing sent yet another force 'to restore order' but when it arrived the situation had already been stabilised under the leadership of the [[7th Dalai Lama]] who was now seen to have demonstrated loyalty to the Qing. Just as Güshi Khan had done with the Fifth Dalai Lama, they therefore helped reconstitute the government with the Dalai Lama presiding over a [[Kashag]] of four Tibetans, reinvesting him with temporal power in addition to his already established spiritual leadership. This arrangement, with a Kashag under the Dalai Lama or his regent, outlasted the Qing dynasty which collapsed in 1912.<ref>Van Schaik 2011, p. 144; Shakabpa 1967, p. 150.</ref> The ''ambans'' and their garrison were also reinstated to observe and to some extent supervise affairs, however, although their influence generally waned with the power of their empire which gradually declined after 1792 along with its influence over Tibet, a decline aided by a succession of corrupt or incompetent ''ambans''.<ref>Smith 1997, p. 137.</ref> Moreover, there was soon no reason for the Qing to fear the [[Dzungar people|Dzungar]]; by the time the [[Seventh Dalai Lama]] died in 1757 at the age of 49, the entire [[Dzungar people]] had been practically exterminated through years of genocidal campaigns by Qing armies, and deadly smallpox epidemics, with the survivors being forcibly transported into China. Their emptied lands were then awarded to other peoples.<ref>Smith 1997, p. 132–3.</ref>

According to Mullin, despite living through such violent times Kelzang Gyatso was perhaps 'the most spiritually learned and accomplished of any Dalai Lama', his written works comprising several hundred titles including 'some of Tibet's finest spiritual literary achievements'.<ref>Mullin 2001, p. 302, p. 308.</ref> In addition, despite his apparent lack of zeal in politics, Kelzang Gyatso is credited with establishing in 1751 the reformed government of Tibet headed by the Dalai Lama, which continued over 200 years until the 1950s, and then in exile.<ref>Mullin 2001, p. 303.</ref> Construction of the [[Norbulingka]], the 'Summer Palace' of the Dalai Lamas in Lhasa was also started during Kelzang Gyatso's reign.<ref>{{cite news|author1=Suhasini Haidar|title=At Lhasa, Tibetans still pray for Dalai Lama's return|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/world/at-lhasa-tibetans-still-pray-for-dalai-lamas-return/article6367393.ece|access-date=19 July 2015|newspaper=The Hindu|date=1 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Introduction to The Potala Palace, Jokhang Temple and Norbulingka, Tibet|url=http://worldheritage.routes.travel/world-heritage-site/the-potala-palace-jokhang-temple-and-norbulingka-tibet/|publisher=World Heritage|access-date=19 July 2015|quote=Norbulingka was built in the 1700s by the seventh Dalai Lama and served as the regular dwelling of future Dalai Lamas.

The Dalai Lama, his later generations and the local government cherished both the jade seal of authority, and the jade sheets of authority. They were properly preserved as the root to their ruling power.<ref name="Wang尼玛坚赞1997_p62" />

Although the 8th Dalai Lama lived almost as long as the [[Seventh Dalai Lama|Seventh]] he was overshadowed by many contemporary lamas in terms of both religious and political accomplishment. According to Mullin, the [[14th Dalai Lama]] has pointed to certain indications that [[Jamphel Gyatso]] might not have been the incarnation of the [[7th Dalai Lama]] but of Jamyang Chojey, a disciple of [[Tsongkhapa]] and founder of Drepung monastery who was also reputed to be an incarnation of [[Avalokiteshvara]]. In any case, he mainly lived a quiet and unassuming life as a devoted and studious monk, uninvolved in the kind of dramas that had surrounded his predecessors.<ref>Mullin 2001, pp. 323–7.</ref>

Nevertheless, [[Jamphel Gyatso]] was also said to possess all the signs of being the true incarnation of the [[Seventh Dalai Lama|Seventh]]. This was also claimed to have been confirmed by many portents clear to the Tibetans and so, in 1762, at the age of 5, he was duly enthroned as the [[Eighth Dalai Lama]] at the [[Potala Palace]].<ref>Mullin 2001, pp. 328–332.</ref> At the age of 23 he was persuaded to assume the throne as ruler of Tibet with a [[Regent]] to assist him and after three years of this, when the Regent went to Beijing as ambassador in 1784, he continued to rule solo for a further four years. Feeling unsuited to worldly affairs, however, and unhappy in this role, he then retired from public office to concentrate on religious activities for his remaining 16 years until his death in 1804.<ref>Mullin 2001, pp. 333–4.</ref> He is also credited with the construction of the [[Norbulingka]] 'Summer Palace' started by his predecessor in Lhasa and with ordaining some ten thousand monks in his efforts to foster monasticism.<ref>Mullin 2001 pp. 338–9.</ref>

=== 9th to 12th Dalai Lamas ===
Hugh Richardson's summary of the period covering the four short-lived, 19th-century Dalai Lamas:
{{quote|After him [the [[8th Dalai Lama]], Jamphel Gyatso], the [[9th Dalai Lama|9th]] and [[10th Dalai Lama]]s died before attaining their majority: one of them is credibly stated to have been murdered and strong suspicion attaches to the other. The [[11th Dalai Lama|11th]] and [[12th Dalai Lama|12th]] were each enthroned but died soon after being invested with power. For 113 years, therefore, supreme authority in Tibet was in the hands of a Lama Regent, except for about two years when a lay noble held office and for short periods of nominal rule by the 11th and 12th Dalai Lamas.{{efn|According to Mullin, Smith and Shakabpa however, the 12th Dalai Lama's Regent, Reting Rinpoche, was deposed in 1862 in a coup by Gyalpo Shetra and Tibet was ruled by despots or assemblies of abbots and ministers for the next eleven years, that is until 1873 when the 12th Dalai Lama assumed power.}}<br />It has sometimes been suggested that this state of affairs was brought about by the Ambans—the Imperial Residents in Tibet—because it would be easier to control the Tibet through a Regent than when a Dalai Lama, with his absolute power, was at the head of the government. That is not true. The regular ebb and flow of events followed its set course. The Imperial Residents in Tibet, after the first flush of zeal in 1750, grew less and less interested and efficient. Tibet was, to them, exile from the urbanity and culture of Peking; and so far from dominating the Regents, the Ambans allowed themselves to be dominated. It was the ambition and greed for power of Tibetans that led to five successive Dalai Lamas being subjected to continuous tutelage. {{harv|Richardson|1984|pp=59–60}}}}

[[Thubten Jigme Norbu]], the elder brother of the 14th Dalai Lama, described these unfortunate events as follows, although there are few, if any, indications that any of the four were said to be 'Chinese-appointed imposters':
{{quote|It is perhaps more than a coincidence that between the seventh and the thirteenth holders of that office, only one reached his majority. The eighth, Gyampal Gyatso, died when he was in his thirties, Lungtog Gyatso when he was eleven, Tsultrim Gyatso at eighteen, Khadrup Gyatso when he was eighteen also, and Krinla Gyatso at about the same age. The circumstances are such that it is very likely that some, if not all, were poisoned, either by loyal Tibetans for being Chinese-appointed impostors, or by the Chinese for not being properly manageable. Many Tibetans think that this was done at the time when the young [Dalai Lama] made his ritual visit to the Lake Lhamtso. ... Each of the four [Dalai Lamas] to die young expired shortly after his visit to the lake. Many said it was because they were not the true reincarnations, but imposters imposed by the Chinese. Others tell stories of how the cooks of the retinue, which in those days included many Chinese, were bribed to put poison in the [Dalai Lama's] food. The 13th [Dalai Lama] did not visit Lhamtso until he was 25 years old. He was adequately prepared by spiritual exercise and he also had faithful cooks. The Chinese were disappointed when he did not die like his predecessors, and he was to live long enough to give them much more cause for regret.{{harv|Norbu|Turnbull|1968|pp.=311–312}}{{efn|According to their biographies, the [[8th Dalai Lama|Eighth, Jamphel Gyatso]] lived to 46 years old, the [[9th Dalai Lama|Ninth, Lungtok Gyatso]] to 9 years, the [[10th Dalai Lama|Tenth, Tsultrim Gyatso]] to 21, the [[Khedrup Gyatso|Eleventh, Khedrup Gyatso]] to 17 and the [[Trinley Gyatso|Twelfth, Trinley Gyatso]] to 18.}}}}

According to Mullin, on the other hand, it is improbable that the [[Manchus]] would have murdered any of these four for being 'unmanageable' since it would have been in their best interests to have strong Dalai Lamas ruling in Lhasa, he argues, agreeing with [[Hugh Edward Richardson|Richardson]] that it was rather "the ambition and greed for power of Tibetans" that might have caused the Lamas' early deaths.{{efn|Considering what occurred in Lhasa after the Chinese ''ambans'' murdered [[Gyurme Namgyal]] in 1750, however, the Manchus would have been particularly reluctant to murder a Dalai Lama.}} Further, if Tibetan nobles murdered any of them, it would more likely have been in order to protect or enhance their family interests rather than out of suspicion that the Dalai Lamas were seen as Chinese-appointed imposters as suggested by Norbu. They could also have died from illnesses, possibly contracted from diseases to which they had no immunity, carried to Lhasa by the multitudes of pilgrims visiting from nearby countries for blessings. Finally, from the Buddhist point of view, Mullin says, "Simply stated, these four Dalai Lamas died young because the world did not have enough good karma to deserve their presence".<ref>Mullin 2001, pp. 343–6.</ref>

Tibetan historian K. Dhondup, however, in his history ''The Water-Bird and Other Years'', based on the Tibetan minister Surkhang Sawang Chenmo's historical manuscripts,<ref>Dhondup 1986, p. iv.</ref> disagrees with Mullin's opinion that having strong Dalai Lamas in power in Tibet would have been in China's best interests. He notes that many historians are compelled to suspect Manchu foul play in these serial early deaths because the Ambans had such latitude to interfere; the Manchu, he says, "''to perpetuate their domination over Tibetan affairs, did not desire a Dalai Lama who will ascend the throne and become a strong and capable ruler over his own country and people''". The life and deeds of the 13th Dalai Lama [in successfully upholding ''de facto'' Tibetan independence from China from 1912 to 1950] serve as the living proof of this argument, he points out.<ref>Dhondup 1986, p. 3.</ref> This account also corresponds with TJ Norbu's observations above.

Finally, while acknowledging the possibility, the [[14th Dalai Lama]] himself doubts they were poisoned. He ascribes the probable cause of these early deaths to negligence, foolishness and lack of proper medical knowledge and attention. "''Even today''" he is quoted as saying, "''when people get sick, some [Tibetans] will say: 'Just do your prayers, you don't need medical treatment.'''"<ref>Laird 2006, p. 197.</ref>

==== 9th Dalai Lama ====

Born in Kham in 1805/6 amidst the usual miraculous signs the [[9th Dalai Lama|Ninth Dalai Lama, Lungtok Gyatso]] was appointed by the [[7th Panchen Lama]]'s search team at the age of two and enthroned in the Potala in 1808 at an impressive ceremony attended by representatives from China, Mongolia, Nepal and Bhutan.<ref>Mullin 2001, p. 346–8.</ref><ref>Shakabpa 1984, p. 172.</ref> Tibetan historian Nyima Gyaincain and Wang Jiawei point out that the 9th Dalai Lama was allowed to use the seal of authority given to the late 8th Dalai Lama by the Emperor of China<ref name="Wang尼玛坚赞1997_p71">{{cite book|author1=Jiawei Wang|author2=尼玛坚赞|title=The Historical Status of China's Tibet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ak3SQTVS7acC&pg=PA71|year=1997|publisher=五洲传播出版社|isbn=978-7-80113-304-5|pages=71–}}</ref>

==== 10th Dalai Lama ====
{{Main|10th Dalai Lama}}
Like the [[Seventh Dalai Lama]], the [[10th Dalai Lama|Tenth, Tsultrim Gyatso]], was born in [[Lithang]], [[Kham]], where the Third Dalai Lama had built a monastery. It was 1816 and Regent Demo Tulku and the [[Seventh Panchen Lama]] followed indications from [[Nechung]], the 'state oracle' which led them to appoint him at the age of two. He passed all the tests and was brought to Lhasa but official recognition was delayed until 1822 when he was enthroned and ordained by the Seventh Panchen Lama. There are conflicting reports about whether the Chinese '[[Golden Urn]]' was utilised by drawing lots to choose him.<ref name=S138>Smith 1996, p. 138.</ref> The 10th Dalai Lama mentioned in his biography that he was allowed to use the golden seal of authority based on the convention set up by the late Dalai Lama.

==== 11th Dalai Lama ====
{{Main|11th Dalai Lama}}
Born in Gathar, [[Kham]] in 1838 and soon discovered by the official search committee with the help of [[Nechung Oracle]], the [[11th Dalai Lama|Eleventh Dalai Lama]] was brought to Lhasa in 1841 and recognised, enthroned and named [[Khedrup Gyatso]] by the [[Panchen Lama]] in 1842, who also ordained him in 1846. After that he was immersed in religious studies under the Panchen Lama, amongst other great masters. Meanwhile, there were court intrigues and ongoing power struggles taking place between the various Lhasa factions, the Regent, the [[Kashag]], the powerful nobles and the abbots and monks of the three great monasteries. The Tsemonling Regent<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://treasuryoflives.org/biographies/view/Trichen-73-Ngawang-Jampel-Tsultrim-Gyatso/6979|title=The Second Tsemonling, Ngawang Jampel Tsultrim Gyatso|website=The Treasury of Lives}}</ref> became mistrusted and was forcibly deposed, there were machinations, plots, beatings and kidnappings of ministers and so forth, resulting at last in the Panchen Lama being appointed as interim Regent to keep the peace. Eventually the Third Reting Rinpoche was made Regent, and in 1855, Khedrup Gyatso, appearing to be an extremely promising prospect, was requested to take the reins of power at the age of 17. He was enthroned as ruler of Tibet in 1855<ref name=M361-7>Mullin 2001, pp. 361–7.</ref><ref name=S176-81>Shakabpa 1984, pp. 176–181.</ref> following [[Xianfeng Emperor]]'s order.<ref name="陈庆英2005_p91">{{cite book|author=陈庆英|title=达赖喇嘛转世及历史定制英|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=haMIsdC3iZwC&pg=PA91|year=2005|publisher=五洲传播出版社|isbn=978-7-5085-0745-3|pages=91–}}</ref> He died after just 11 months, no reason for his sudden and premature death being given in these accounts, Shakabpa and Mullin's histories both being based on untranslated Tibetan chronicles. The respected Reting Rinpoche was recalled once again to act as Regent and requested to lead the search for the next incarnation, the twelfth.<ref name=M361-7 /><ref name=S176-81 />

==== 12th Dalai Lama ====
{{Main|12th Dalai Lama}}
In 1856 a child was born in south [[central Tibet]] amidst all the usual extraordinary signs. He came to the notice of the search team, was investigated, passed the traditional tests and was recognised as the [[12th Dalai Lama]] in 1858. The use of the Chinese [[Golden Urn]] at the insistence of the Regent, who was later accused of being a Chinese lackey, confirmed this choice to the satisfaction of all. Renamed [[Trinley Gyatso]] and enthroned in 1860 the boy underwent 13 years of intensive tutelage and training before stepping up to rule Tibet at the age of 17.<ref name=M367>Mullin 2001, pp. 367–373.</ref>

His minority seems a time of even deeper Lhasan political intrigue and power struggles than his predecessor's. By 1862 this led to a coup by Wangchuk Shetra, a minister whom the Regent had banished for conspiring against him. Shetra contrived to return, deposed the Regent, who fled to China, and seized power, appointing himself 'Desi' or Prime Minister.<ref name=M367 /> He then ruled with "absolute power" for three years,<ref name=S188>Shakabpa 1984, pp. 188–9.</ref> quelling a major rebellion in northern Kham in 1863 and re-establishing Tibetan control over significant [[Qing]]-held territory there.<ref name=Sm140>Smith 1997, p. 140.</ref> Shetra died in 1864 and the [[Kashag]] re-assumed power. The retired 76th [[Ganden Tripa]], Khyenrab Wangchuk, was appointed as 'Regent' but his role was limited to supervising and mentoring Trinley Gyatso.<ref name=M367 /><ref name=S188 />

In 1868 Shetra's coup organiser, a semi-literate [[Ganden]] monk named Palden Dondrup, seized power by another coup and ruled as a cruel despot for three years, putting opponents to death by having them 'sewn into fresh animal skins and thrown in the river'.<ref name=S188 /> In 1871, at the request of officials outraged after Dondrup had done just that with one minister and imprisoned several others, he in turn was ousted and committed suicide after a counter-coup coordinated by the supposedly powerless 'Regent' Khyenrab Wangchuk.<ref name=S188 /> As a result of this action this venerable old Regent, who died the next year, is fondly remembered by Tibetans as saviour of the Dalai Lama and the nation. The Kashag and the Tsongdu or National Assembly were re-instated, and, presided over by a Dalai Lama or his Regent, ruled without further interruption until 1959.<ref name=M367 />

According to Smith, however, during Trinley Gyatso's minority, the Regent was deposed in 1862 for abuse of authority and closeness with China, by an alliance of monks and officials called ''Gandre Drungche'' (Ganden and Drepung Monks Assembly); this body then ruled Tibet for ten years until dissolved, when a National Assembly of monks and officials called the ''Tsongdu'' was created and took over. Smith makes no mention of Shetra or Dondrup acting as usurpers and despots in this period.<ref name=Sm140 />

In any case, Trinley Gyatso died within three years of assuming power. In 1873, at the age of 20 "he suddenly became ill and passed away".<ref name=M367 /> On the cause of his early death, accounts diverge. Mullin relates an interesting theory, based on cited Tibetan sources: out of concern for the monastic tradition, Trinley Gyatso chose to die and reincarnate as the [[13th Dalai Lama]], rather than taking the option of marrying a woman called Rigma Tsomo from Kokonor and leaving an heir to "oversee Tibet's future".<ref>Mullin 2001, pp. 373–375.</ref> Shakabpa on the other hand, without citing sources, notes that Trinley Gyatso was influenced and manipulated by two close acquaintances who were subsequently accused of having a hand in his fatal illness and imprisoned, tortured and exiled as a result.<ref>Shakabpa 1984, p. 191.</ref>

[[File:Throne awaiting Dalai Lama's return. Summer residence Nechung. 1993.JPG|upright|thumb|Throne awaiting Dalai Lama's return. Summer residence of 14th Dalai Lama, [[Nechung]], Tibet.]]

The [[13th Dalai Lama]] assumed ruling power from the monasteries, which previously had great influence on the Regent, in 1895. Due to his two periods of exile in 1904–1909 to escape the British invasion of 1904, and from 1910–1912 to escape a Chinese invasion, he became well aware of the complexities of international politics and was the first Dalai Lama to become aware of the importance of foreign relations. After his return from exile in India and [[Sikkim]] during January 1913, he assumed control of foreign relations and dealt directly with the [[Maharaja]], with the British Political officer in Sikkim and with the king of [[Nepal]] – rather than letting the Kashag or parliament do it. {{harv|Sheel|1989|pp=24, 29}}

The Thirteenth issued a Declaration of Independence for his kingdom in [[Ü-Tsang]] from China during the summer of 1912 and standardised a Tibetan flag, though no other sovereign state recognized Tibetan independence. {{harv|Sheel|1989|p=20}} He expelled the [[amban]]s and all Chinese civilians in the country and instituted many measures to modernise Tibet. These included provisions to curb excessive demands on peasants for provisions by the monasteries and tax evasion by the nobles, setting up an independent police force, the abolition of the death penalty, extension of secular education, and the provision of electricity throughout the city of Lhasa in the 1920s. {{harv|Norbu|Turnbull|1968|pp=317–318}} He died in 1933.

== Residences ==
The 1st Dalai Lama was based at [[Tashi Lhunpo Monastery]], which he founded, and the Second to the Fifth Dalai Lamas were mainly based at Drepung Monastery outside Lhasa. In 1645, after the unification of Tibet, the Fifth moved to the ruins of a royal fortress or residence on top of ''Marpori'' ('Red Mountain') in Lhasa and decided to build a palace on the same site. This ruined palace, called Tritse Marpo, was originally built around 636 AD by the founder of the [[Tibetan Empire]], [[Songtsen Gampo]] for his Nepalese wife.<ref>Shakabpa 1984, pp. 112–113.</ref> Amongst the ruins there was just a small temple left where [[Tsongkhapa]] had given a teaching when he arrived in Lhasa in the 1380s. The Fifth Dalai Lama began construction of the [[Potala Palace]] on this site in 1645,<ref>Laird 2006, p. 177.</ref> carefully incorporating what was left of his predecessor's palace into its structure.<ref name=mull201 /> From then on and until today, unless on tour or in exile the Dalai Lamas have always spent their winters at the Potala Palace and their summers at the [[Norbulingka]] palace and park. Both palaces are in Lhasa and approximately 3&nbsp;km apart.

Following the failed [[1959 Tibetan uprising]], the 14th Dalai Lama sought refuge in India. Indian Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] allowed in the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan government officials. The Dalai Lama has since lived in exile in [[McLeod Ganj]], in the Kangra district of [[Himachal Pradesh]] in northern India, where the [[Central Tibetan Administration]] is also established. His residence on the Temple Road in McLeod Ganj is called the [[Namgyal_Monastery|Dalai Lama Temple]] and is visited by people from across the globe. Tibetan refugees have constructed and opened many schools and Buddhist temples in Dharamshala.<ref>[http://www.brooklynrail.org/2008/04/express/dispatches-from-the-tibetan-front-dharamsala-india "Dispatches from the Tibetan Front: Dharamshala, India,"] Litia Perta, ''The Brooklyn Rail'', 4 April 2008</ref>

== Searching for the reincarnation ==
[[File:DLHaus.jpg|thumb|The search for the 14th Dalai Lama took the High Lamas to [[Taktser]] in [[Amdo]]]]

By the Himalayan tradition, ''[[phowa]]'' is the discipline that is believed to transfer the mindstream to the intended body. Upon the death of the Dalai Lama and consultation with the [[Nechung Oracle]], a search for the Lama's ''yangsi'', or [[reincarnation]], is conducted.<ref name="sdpcnw">{{cite web|title=The Dalai Lama|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/people/dalailama_1.shtml|publisher=BBC|access-date=17 May 2008|date=21 September 2006}}</ref> The government of the People's Republic of China has stated its intention to be the ultimate authority on the selection of the next Dalai Lama.<ref>{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=China's Tensions With Dalai Lama Spill into the Afterlife|author=Buckley, Chris|date=11 March 2015|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/12/world/asia/chinas-tensions-with-dalai-lama-spill-into-the-afterlife.html}}</ref>

High Lamas may also claim to have a vision by a dream or if the Dalai Lama was cremated, they will often monitor the direction of the smoke as an 'indication' of the direction of the expected rebirth.<ref name="sdpcnw" />

If there is only one boy found, the High Lamas will invite Living Buddhas of the three great monasteries, together with secular clergy and monk officials, to 'confirm their findings' and then report to the Central Government through the Minister of Tibet. Later, a group consisting of the three major servants of Dalai Lama, eminent officials,{{who|date=May 2013}} and troops{{which|date=May 2013}} will collect the boy and his family and travel to Lhasa, where the boy would be taken, usually to Drepung Monastery, to study the Buddhist sutra in preparation for assuming the role of spiritual leader of Tibet.<ref name="sdpcnw" />

If there are several possible claimed reincarnations, however, regents, eminent officials, monks at the [[Jokhang]] in Lhasa, and the Minister to Tibet have historically decided on the individual by putting the boys' names inside an urn and drawing one lot in public if it was too difficult to judge the reincarnation initially.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dalai Lama's confirmation of reincarnation|url=http://www.tibettravel.info/tibetan-buddhism/confirmation-of-reincarnation.html|publisher=Tibet Travel info|access-date=17 May 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080331073155/http://www.tibettravel.info/tibetan-buddhism/confirmation-of-reincarnation.html|archive-date=31 March 2008}}</ref>

There has also been one non-recognised Dalai Lama, [[Yeshe Gyatso|Ngawang Yeshe Gyatso]], declared 28 June 1707, when he was 25 years old, by [[Lha-bzang Khan]] as the "true" 6th Dalai Lama – however, he was never accepted as such by the majority of the population.<ref name="Stein 1972, p. 85" /><ref>[[F.

{{quote|In the mid-1970s, Tenzin Gyatso told a Polish newspaper that he thought he would be the last Dalai Lama. In a later interview published in the English language press he stated, "The Dalai Lama office was an institution created to benefit others.

Many could not believe that such an option could even be considered. It was further felt that it was not the Dalai Lama's decision to reincarnate. Rather, they felt that since the Dalai Lama is a national institution it was up to the people of Tibet to decide whether the Dalai Lama should reincarnate.<ref>Verhaegen 2002, p. 5.</ref>|sign=|source=}}

The government of the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) has claimed the power to approve the naming of "high" reincarnations in Tibet, based on a precedent set by the [[Qianlong Emperor]] of the [[Qing dynasty]].<ref>{{cite magazine|title=China Says It Will Decide Who the Dalai Lama Shall Be Reincarnated As|url=http://time.com/3743742/dalai-lama-china-reincarnation-tibet-buddhism/|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=13 March 2015|access-date=17 December 2015}}</ref> The Qianlong Emperor instituted a system of selecting the Dalai Lama and the [[Panchen Lama]] by a lottery that used a [[Golden Urn]] with names wrapped in clumps of barley.

In September 2007, the Chinese government said [[State Religious Affairs Bureau Order No. 5|all high monks must be approved by the government]], which would include the selection of the [[15th Dalai Lama]] after the death of [[14th Dalai Lama|Tenzin Gyatso]].<ref name="ChinaDaily">{{cite web|title=Reincarnation of living Buddha needs gov't approval|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2007-08/04/content_5448242.htm|website=China Daily|access-date=11 March 2018}}</ref><ref name="Guardian">{{cite news|last1=Ramesh|first1=Randeep|last2=Watts|first2=Jonathan|title=Dalai Lama challenges China – with a referendum on reincarnation|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/nov/28/china.religion|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=11 March 2018|date=28 November 2007}}</ref> Since by tradition, the Panchen Lama must approve the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama, that is another possible method of control.

In response to this scenario, [[Tashi Wangdi]], the representative of the [[14th Dalai Lama]], replied that the Chinese government's selection would be meaningless. "You can't impose an [[Imam]], an [[Archbishop]], saints, any religion...you can't politically impose these things on people", said Wangdi. "It has to be a decision of the followers of that tradition. The Chinese can use their political power: force. Again, it's meaningless. Like their Panchen Lama. And they can't keep their Panchen Lama in Tibet. They tried to bring him to his monastery many times but people would not see him.
